# Inductor Capacitor Voltage Controlled Oscillator with Frequency Divider

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  
The implementation of a Cross-Coupled LC-VCO (Inductor Capacitor Voltage-Controlled Oscillator) with a frequency divider is driven by its performance and adaptability. These VCOs provide excellent frequency stability, low phase noise, and a wide tuning range, 
making them ideal for precision-demanding applications like RF and wireless communication. Their energy efficiency suits battery-powered devices, while the integration of a frequency divider supports frequency multiplication, division, and synchronization in tasks
such as clock generation and phase-locked loops. Key design considerations include phase noise, tuning range, power consumption, center frequency, and figure of merit, with trade-offs balanced to meet project requirements.

# Objective and Tasks

<div style="text-align: justify;">

This project aims to design a 60GHz Cross-Coupled LC Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO) integrated with a Divider Chain and Buffer, ensuring proper functionality through electromagnetic (EM) simulations in 130nm SiGe BiCMOS technology. The process covers all stages, 
from initial design to post-layout simulations, EM analysis, and design optimization.
